# Docker Extension for PMM

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ It is unsupported software and not published, please consider using the officially supported method of installing PMM Server https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/index.html :)

Docker extension for Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM). We will learn how to run, install and deploy our [Docker Extension](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/extensions/).

**PMM** is a best-of-breed open source database monitoring solution. It provides great metrics of **MySQL** and **MongoDB** in depth which helps to improve performance of the database stack and helps to find root cause of any issue.

See the [PMM](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html) Documentation for more information.
